/*The automatic polarizer manages the face types of the epithelial cells. It first detects if there 
are lumens in the geometry and then mark the faces in contact with the lumen as apical. The faces that are 
in contact with another cell are marked lateral, and the faces in contact with the exterior space are 
marked as basal. 

The automatic polarizer detects luminal, cytoplasmic and the exterior space by discretizing the 
simulation space. Then the cell surfaces are used to create boundaries in this discretized space.
and finally the different regions are detected with the Hoshenâ€“Kopelman algorithm.
